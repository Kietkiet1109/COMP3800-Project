        Together, they embarked upon an impact-driven mission to prioritize and redesign the future of women's health education.
    
        Their team launched the company's first flagship model “Venus” in 2021, which validated the market gap with its swift uptake throughout 24 countries worldwide. Since then, the Granville team have continued their innovative journey with the release of their latest model "Iris" for medical device demonstrations.
